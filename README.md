# Polarix Harmonic Drive Mount



I am sharing my designs and data for my DIY Harmonic Drive mount that I designed and manufactured locally in Amman Jordan.
This mount is much cheaper than if purchased as a ready made from China of any brand for a similar payload.



Total cost for me for the parts was around 375JOD, which is equivalent to around 530USD. The extra cost was due to our local customs and duties which were extremely overexaggerated by the customs officer who claimed that the parts like the FYSETC E4 and the 0.9deg NEMA 17 Motors are solely designated for 3D printers and we have a "non-just" law here in Jordan that all 3D printers and their (PARTS) must have prior authorization from the ministry of interior which took too much time and cost.



The mount is designed with rated load of 15kg without counterweight, and around 20kg with counterweight.



The firmware is based on open-source project OnstepX firmware, which is computerized telescope control system designed to give GoTo (computerized tracking) capabilities to a variety of telescope mounts.



I have uploaded the designs which were done using Autodesk Inventor 2025 Pro to the folder Inventor.

Parts list is also uploaded in the relevant folder.



I have upload a video to YouTube showing the full assembly process (link: https://youtu.be/akRYA4y\_P54?si=zxj99GgIfXwSHArk )



Special thanks to Mountzilla, AlkaidMount, astrophile project owners and many others for inspiring me to do my own mount.
